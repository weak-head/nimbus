## Overview

Nimbus stands as a comprehensive data backup manager and service deployment orchestrator tailored for homelabs, media centers, and local development environments. It offers a seamless, turnkey solution to streamline your data management and service orchestration needs. While Nimbus is robust for personal or developmental use, it is not intended to supplant production-level or mission-critical tools designed for commercial-scale backups and deployments.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) for installing Nimbus:

```bash
pipx install nimbuscli --python python3.12
ni --version
```

Before using Nimbus you need to configure it. By default, Nimbus looks for its configuration file at `~/.nimbus/config.yaml`. All application configurations are centralized within this file.  Below is a minimal example configuration:

```yaml
commands:
  deploy:
    services:
      - ~/services
  backup:
    destination: ~/backups
    archive: tar
    directories:
      docs:
        - ~/Documents
```

> [!TIP]
> When using the `ni` command, itâ€™s essential to use `\*` in place of `*` when specifying a selector that follows a glob pattern. This is because `bash` or `sh` interprets `*` as a glob pattern and attempts to expand it before passing it to `ni`. By escaping the asterisk (`\*`), you ensure that `ni` receives the character literally, allowing it to process the glob pattern as intended.

With the above configuration:
- `ni up` deploys all Docker Compose services under `~/services`.
- `ni backup` creates a `tar` backup of the `~/Documents` directory and saves it under `~/backups/docs/Documents/Documents_{datetime}.tar`.
- Notifications (such as Discord or email) are disabled.
- Generation of the operation report is also disabled.

For additional configuration options, refer to the [example configuration file](https://github.com/weak-head/nimbus/blob/main/docs/config.example.yaml).


## Backups

The `backup` command facilitates the creation of backups and enables their optional upload to a remote destination, such as an AWS S3 bucket. The command accepts optional group selectors, that filter the configured backup groups using specified [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).

```bash
ni backup [selectors]
```

### Directory Groups

Nimbus organizes backup directories into directory groups, allowing you to manage and back up specific sets of data. Each directory group can be backed up independently. You can also select multiple groups using group selectors. If no group selectors are specified, all directory groups will be backed up.

Consider the following directory groups defined in your configuration:

```yaml
directories: 
  photos:
    - ~/Pictures
  cloud:
    - ~/.nextcloud
  docs:
    - ~/Documents
```
With these directory groups, the following `backup` commands would result in:

| Command | Selected Groups |
| --- | --- |
| `ni backup` | `photos` `cloud` `docs` |
| `ni backup nx*` | _(No groups selected)_ |
| `ni backup photos` | `photos` |
| `ni backup ph* *cloud*` | `photos` `cloud` |
| `ni backup *o??` | `cloud` `docs` |

### Archiver Profiles

Nimbus supports various archiver backends for creating backups. Each backend has a default profile with a matching name. For example the `tar` backend has a default `tar` profile that could be used using the `archive: tar` configuration. You can also create custom profiles or overwrite default ones.

**Available Archiver Backends**

| Backend | Support | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zip` | Native | [zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) archive |
| `tar` | Native | [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) archive |
| `rar` | Requires installation of [rar](https://www.win-rar.com/) | [rar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR_(file_format)) archive |

**Customizing Archiver Profiles**

You can define custom profiles in your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
profiles:
  archive:
    - name: rar # Overwrite default 'rar' profile
      provider: rar
      recovery: 5
    - name: rar_protected
      provider: rar
      password: SecretPwd
      recovery: 3
      compression: 1
```

In the above example:
- The `rar` profile is overwritten with custom settings (`recovery level: 5`).
- A new profile named `rar_protected` is defined with a password, recovery level, and compression settings.

Remember to adjust the profiles according to your backup requirements. For detailed configuration options, refer to the [example configuration file](https://github.com/weak-head/nimbus/blob/main/docs/config.example.yaml).

### Uploader Profiles

Nimbus supports various uploader backends for uploading the created archives. If you want to use the upload functionality, consider creating a custom uploader profile.

**Available Uploader Backends**

| Backend | Support | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws` | Native | [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket |

**Customizing Uploader Profiles**

Define custom profiles in your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
profiles:
  upload:
    - name: aws_store
      provider: aws
      access_key: XXXXXXX
      secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
      bucket: aws.storage.bucket
      storage_class: STANDARD
    - name: aws_archival
      provider: aws
      access_key: XXXXXXX
      secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      bucket: aws.archival.bucket
      storage_class: DEEP_ARCHIVE
```

In the above example:
- The `aws_store` profile specifies settings for storing backups in an S3 bucket with standard storage class.
- The `aws_archival` profile configures archival storage with a deep archive storage class.

Remember to adjust the profiles according to your backup requirements. For detailed configuration options, refer to the [example configuration file](https://github.com/weak-head/nimbus/blob/main/docs/config.example.yaml).

## Deployments

The `up` and `down` commands manage deployments of services. Nimbus supports services structured as [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) stacks and performs recursive service discovery for the configured directories. The command accepts optional service selectors, that filter the discovered services using specified [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).

```bash
ni up [selectors]
ni down [selectors]
```

Lets assume we have the following Nimbus configuration:

```yaml
commands:
  deploy:
    services:
      - ~/.nimbus/services
```

And under the `~/.nimbus/services` we have the following directory structure:

```
|- services
    |- shared
        |- media
            |- .env
            |- compose.yaml
        |- getty
            |- deploy.sh
            |- readme.md
    |- cloud
        |- .env
        |- compose.yaml
    |- git
        |- some_file.txt 
        |- start.sh
```

With this configuration and directory structure, the following deployment commands would result in:

| Command | Selected Services |
| --- | --- |
| `ni up` | `media` `cloud` |
| `ni up media` | `media` |
| `ni down g*` | _(No services selected)_ |
| `ni down git` | _(No services selected)_ |
| `ni down cl*` | `cloud` |
