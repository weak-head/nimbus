## Overview

Nimbus stands as a comprehensive data backup manager and service deployment orchestrator tailored for homelabs, media centers, and local development environments. It offers a seamless, turnkey solution to streamline your data management and service orchestration needs. While Nimbus is robust for personal or developmental use, it is not intended to supplant production-level or mission-critical tools designed for commercial-scale backups and deployments.

## Getting Started

It is recommended to install nimbus using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/):

```bash
pipx install nimbuscli --python python3.12
ni --version
```

Before using nimbus you need to configure it. Below is a minimal example configuration:

```yaml
commands:
  deploy:
    services:
      - ~/services
  backup:
    destination: ~/backups
    archive: tar
    directories:
      docs:
        - ~/Documents
```

- `ni up` deploys all Docker Compose services under `~/services` root directory.
- `ni backup` creates a `tar` backup of the `~/Documents` directory and saves it under `~/backups/docs/Documents/Documents_{datetime}.tar`.
- Notifications (such as Discord or email) are disabled.
- Generation of the operation report is also disabled.

For more configuration options, refer to the [example configuration file](https://github.com/weak-head/nimbus/blob/main/docs/config.example.yaml).

## Usage

By default, Nimbus searches for its configuration file at the `~/.nimbus/config.yaml` path.  
It is anticipated that all configurations for the application will be centralized within this file.  

> [!TIP]
> When using the `ni` command, itâ€™s essential to use `\*` in place of `*`.  
> This is because `bash` or `sh` interprets `*` as a glob pattern and attempts to expand it before passing it to `ni`.  
> By escaping the asterisk (`\*`), you ensure that `ni` receives the character literally, allowing it to process the glob pattern as intended.

### Backups

The `backup` command facilitates the creation of backups and enables their optional upload to a remote destination, such as an AWS S3 bucket.  
The command accepts optional selectors, that filter the configured backup groups using specified [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).

```bash
ni backup [selectors]
```

Lets assume we have the following Nimbus configuration:

```yaml
profiles:
  archive:
    - name: rar-protected
      provider: rar
      password: SecretPassword
      recovery: 3
      compression: 0
  upload:
    - name: aws-archive
      provider: aws
      access_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
      secret_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      bucket: backups.bucket.aws
      storage_class: STANDARD

commands:
  backup:
    destination: ~/.nimbus/backups
    archive: rar-protected
    upload: aws-archive
    directories: 
      photos:
        - ~/Pictures
        - /mnt/photos
      cloud:
        - /mnt/nextcloud
      docs:
        - ~/Documents
```

With this configuration, the following `backup` commands would result in:

| Command | Selected Backup groups |
| --- | --- |
| `ni backup` | photos cloud docs |
| `ni backup nx\*` | |
| `ni backup photos` | photos |
| `ni backup ph\* \*cloud\*` | photos cloud |
| `ni backup \*o\?\?` | cloud docs |

### Deployments

The `up` and `down` commands manage deployments of services. Nimbus supports services structured as [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) stacks and performs recursive service discovery for the configured directories.  
The command accepts optional selectors, that filter the discovered services using specified [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).

```bash
ni up [selectors]
ni down [selectors]
```

Lets assume we have the following Nimbus configuration:

```yaml
commands:
  deploy:
    services:
      - ~/.nimbus/services
```

And under the `~/.nimbus/services` we have the following directory structure:

```
|- services
    |- media
        |- .env
        |- compose.yaml
    |- cloud
        |- .env
        |- compose.yaml
    |- git
        |- some_file.txt 
        |- start.sh
```

With this configuration and directory structure, the following deployment commands would result in:

| Command | Selected Services |
| --- | --- |
| `ni up` | media cloud |
| `ni up media` | media |
| `ni down g\*` | |
| `ni down git` | |
| `ni down cl\*` | cloud |
